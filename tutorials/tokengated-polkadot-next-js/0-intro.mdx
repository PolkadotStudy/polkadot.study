# Tokengated Website with polkadot.js and next-auth

In recent years, tokengated websites have become an increasingly popular way to
control access to sensitive information or functionality on a website. With web3
that can now be done without username + password authentication but instead
using a wallet and a browser extension.

The use cases for tokengated websites are diverse, ranging from user
authentication and authorization, to paid content, to API access control. In the
context of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) or other crypto tokens, tokengated
websites can be used to provide exclusive access to content or functionality
based on the ownership of these tokens. This could include early access to new
releases, special events, or other benefits.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a tokengated
website that is specifically designed to work with NFTs or other crypto tokens.
We will cover the basics of token authentication in substrate based chains with
the polkadot js API and how to create exclusive content and functionality that
is only accessible to users who own specific tokens.
