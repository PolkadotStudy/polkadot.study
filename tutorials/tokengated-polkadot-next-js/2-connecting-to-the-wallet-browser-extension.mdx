# Connecting to the wallet browser extension

This section will teach you about how to connect to the polkadot browser
extension and some caveats with next js.

## A ContextProvider for polkadot accounts

While this is not a tutorial on react context, this demo dApp is a
[paradigmatic example of when react context is useful](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context#use-cases-for-context).
It will provide all components in the dApp with context: in our case, that is
amongst others

- the accounts that come from the browser extension
- the selected account
- the injector of the selected account (which can be used for signing data /
  transactions with the browser extension )

All this comes from the polkadot.js browser extension. If you have never worked
with it before, the [cookbook](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/extension/cookbook)
is a good place to start exploring it.

:::info

There are many wallet browser extensions for the polkadot ecosystem. In this
demo we use the basic
[Polkadot\{.js\} "developer" extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).
Other popular extensions are [Talisman](https://www.talisman.xyz/) or
[Subwallet](https://subwallet.app/). The tutorial works for any extension a user
has installed due to the way the third party wallets are injected into the
browser.

While everything in this dApp could be handled without react Context and a
ContextProvider

### Starting with a hook

In modern react, the use of hooks is the state of the art. Hooks let you use
different React features from your components. A `usePolkadotExtension` hook can
be a means of providing data from the wallet browser extension to any component
inside your dApp. While our demo dApp is small and you will only use it in two
distinct components in this demo, you can imagine the usefulness in large
applications.

Let's first think about the returned data and types from of the hook. As
mentioned above it should be aware of

1. `accounts` that hold an array of accounts with its substrate `address` as
   well as some metadata, e.g. the `name` of an account.
1. The `selectedAccountIdx` which will store the index of the account the user
   has selected. Imagine having 10 accounts enabled in the browser extension.
1. In order to sign a message, we need an accounts
   [`injector`](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/extension/cookbook/#sign-a-message)
   which holds the signer we can use.

First, create a new file in `hooks/usePolkadotExtension.ts` and start by copying
the types and the frame for the hook.

```js showLineNumbers title="hooks/usePolkadotExtension.ts"
import {
  InjectedAccountWithMeta,
  InjectedExtension,
} from "@polkadot/extension-inject/types";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { documentReadyPromise } from "./utils";

export interface UsePolkadotExtensionReturnType {
  isReady: boolean;
  accounts: InjectedAccountWithMeta[] | null;
  error: Error | null;
  injector: InjectedExtension | null;
  actingAccount: InjectedAccountWithMeta | null;
  setActingAccountIdx: (idx: number) => void;
}

export const usePolkadotExtension = (): UsePolkadotExtensionReturnType => {
  const [isReady, setIsReady] = useState(false);
  const [accounts, setAccounts] = useState<InjectedAccountWithMeta[] | null>(
    null
  );
  const [extensions, setExtensions] = useState<InjectedExtension[] | null>(
    null
  );
  const [actingAccountIdx, setActingAccountIdx] = useState<number>(0);
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null);
  const [injector, setInjector] = useState<InjectedExtension | null>(null);

  const actingAccount = accounts && accounts[actingAccountIdx];

  // TODO hook logic

  return {
    accounts,
    actingAccount,
    setActingAccountIdx,
    isReady,
    error,
    injector,
  };
};
```

We are creating 6 state variables that will be shared through the inclusion of
`usePolkadotExtension`:

- `isReady`: Accounts were found, the extension is loaded correctly
- `accounts`: Array of accounts from the extension
- `actingAccountIdx`: Which of the accounts in the `accounts` array is currently
  active. You will also use the `setActingAccountIdx` in the `AccountSelect`
  component we already created.
- `error`: The error that was eventually returned from the extension
- `injector`: The active account's injector (which is stored in the hook for
  convenience)

They are not populated yet. Put the following to effects at the point where it
says `TODO`, and try to understand the setup before reading below for an
explanation.

```js showLineNumbers title="hooks/usePolkadotExtension.ts"
  useEffect(() => {
    // This effect is used to setup the browser extension
    const extensionSetup = async () => {
      //highlight-next-line
      const extensionDapp = await import("@polkadot/extension-dapp");
      const { web3AccountsSubscribe, web3Enable } = extensionDapp;

      const injectedPromise = documentReadyPromise(() =>
        web3Enable("Polkadot Tokengated Website Demo")
      );
      const extensions = await injectedPromise;

      setExtensions(extensions);

      if (extensions.length === 0) {
        return;
      }

      if (accounts) {
        setIsReady(true);
      } else {
        let unsubscribe: () => void;

        // we subscribe to any account change
        // note that `web3AccountsSubscribe` returns the function to unsubscribe
        unsubscribe = await web3AccountsSubscribe((injectedAccounts) => {
          setAccounts(injectedAccounts);
        });

        return () => unsubscribe && unsubscribe();
      }
    };

    if (!isReady) {
      extensionSetup();
    }
  }, [extensions]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This effect is used to get the injector from the selected account
    // and is triggered when the accounts or the actingAccountIdx change
    const getInjector = async () => {
      const { web3FromSource } = await import("@polkadot/extension-dapp");
      const actingAccount =
        accounts && actingAccountIdx !== undefined
          ? accounts[actingAccountIdx]
          : undefined;
      if (actingAccount?.meta.source) {
        try {
          const injector = await web3FromSource(actingAccount?.meta.source);
          setInjector(injector);
        } catch (e: any) {
          setError(e);
        }
      }
    };

    getInjector();
  }, [actingAccountIdx, accounts]);
```

The first effect just sets up the extension. It is basically the code from the
[Instructions on how to use the extenion](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/extension/usage),
with some adaptions for next.js:

Because next.js code is rendered for the server and the client we will have a
problem with the extension code, as browser extensions naturally only run on
clients! That is why we need to use a dynamic import (Line 4). The dynamic
import is inside an `useEffect` hook,
[which only runs on the client](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect).
Then, we await the extensions being provided by the polkadot browser extension
and set the accounts coming from the extension as soon as they are available.
That whole `extensionSetup` async function is called when the hook is first
rendered in the DOM _and_ when the extensions change, i.e. a user installs a new
extension / allows an extension to access the dApp.

The second effect just sets the injector state variable whenever the `accounts`
or `actingAccountIdx` state variables change.

Before moving on to the next section, take some time to answer the following
questions if you like to make sure you understood the tutorial content so far.

### Providing Context

> Context lets the parent component make some information available to any
> component in the tree below it—no matter how deep—without passing it
> explicitly through props.
> ([React Dev](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context))

Now that the hook is ready, we could use it in our `_index.ts` to call it once
and then pass the props down. You need the data from the hook in two places (at
the moment):

1. The `Login` component
2. The `AccountSelect` component (which is a child of the `Login` component)

So in this example it is really not a big issue however this tutorial wants to
teach you how to write reusable blocks for larger decentralized applications,
that's why we will do it with context here. Imagine e.g. you would want to add a
component that displays a profile for the currently logged in user, showing
their tokens, or their balances, you would need that `accounts` data over again,
and can with the following code easily reuse it without prop drilling.

:::info

If you have never worked with _Context_ in react before or do not understand
when to use it, read the excellent
[react dev documentation on Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context).

:::

To get started with Context, create a file
`context/polkadot-extension-context.ts` and add the following code.

```js title="context/polkadot-extension-context.ts" showLineNumbers
import { createContext, ReactNode, useContext } from "react";
import {
  usePolkadotExtension,
  UsePolkadotExtensionReturnType,
} from "@/hooks/use-polkadot-extension";

const PolkadotExtensionContext =
  createContext <
  UsePolkadotExtensionReturnType >
  {
    accounts: [],
    error: null,
    isReady: false,
    actingAccount: null,
    injector: null,
    setActingAccountIdx: () => {},
  };

export const usePolkadotExtensionWithContext = () =>
  useContext(PolkadotExtensionContext);

export const PolkadotExtensionContextProvider = ({
  children,
}: {
  children: ReactNode,
}) => {
  const polkadotExtension = usePolkadotExtension();

  return (
    <PolkadotExtensionContext.Provider value={polkadotExtension}>
      {children}
    </PolkadotExtensionContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

You can see that it first defines the `PolkadotExtensionContext` type and its
default values. In lines 19 and 20 a utility hook is defined so that you do not
have to import the `Context` in other files but can directly use the hook. The
`PolkadotExtensionContextProvider` finally is just syntactic sugar for using the
provider with the default value of `usePolkadotExtension()`.

The last step to add Context to your app is now to add the `ContextProvider` to
your `_app.ts` file. It will make the context available to all components.

```js title="pages/_app.tsx" showLineNumbers
import "@/styles/globals.css";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { PolkadotExtensionContextProvider } from "@/context/polkadotExtensionContext";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <PolkadotExtensionContextProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </PolkadotExtensionContextProvider>
  );
}
```

### Recap

Until now, you have first created all required UI components. Then you have
created a custom hook that lets you _use_ the data that comes from the browser
extension. Because it is a good practice to store account data in Context, you
have then created a ContextProvider that lets you use the data in any (future)
component of your dApp.

Now the last and most important thing of the tutorial is to create the actual
authentication flow, that authenticates a user and checks if they have the
tokengated permission to view a route.
