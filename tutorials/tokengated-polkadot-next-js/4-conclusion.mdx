# Conclusion

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations. You just completed the Tokengated Website with Polkadot and
next-auth example. You learned how to use next-auth's composability to write
your own CredentialsProvider that authenticates users using their wallets
signature and then checking if the free balance of the native token on Kusama
chain is > 1.

## Further Studies

If you have a look at the
[tutorial's github repository](https://github.com/niklasp/polkadot-js-tokengated-webssite)
you will find more files than we talked about in this demo. E.g. there is a
usage example with iron-session for the people who want a more lightweight
solution than using next-auth.

Also think about how long you set the valid time for your session cookie.
