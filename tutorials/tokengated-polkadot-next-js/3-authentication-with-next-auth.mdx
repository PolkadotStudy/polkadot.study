# Authentication with next-auth and the Polkadot extension

Authentication in webapps is a recurring task and can be solved in multiple
ways. In nextjs serverless architectures without database access you can either
rely on third party auth services like auth0, or you can use cookies and
sessions to authenticate your users. Generally authentication should solve the
issue of restricting access to users that meet certain criteria, while
preserving usability, i.e. storing auth information in a secure way, without
having to input your credentials / signature over and over.

As authentication is a key to protected web resources, security is very
important and many things can go wrong and must be taken care of. That is why
this tutorial is based on the popular [next-auth](https://authjs.dev/), an _open
source_ auth library that can handle user authentication with many different
given authentication providers like github or Google. It supports databaseless,
serverless architectures by utilizing encrypted JSON Web Tokens for
authenticating users. And abstracts away some of the complexities authentication
in next.js brings.

- next js will pre render pages. pre-rendering. **Static generation** and
  **Server-side** rendering
- `/protected` is a server-side rendered page you will want to protect with the
  authentication and only show its content to authorized users.
- protecting either API routes of the next node js server or protecting
- Typically, Static Generation is the better choice here, because it reduces the
  Time To First Byte (TTI). It's only disadvantage is that it will flash
  unauthorized content as long as a server request loads.
- With Static Generation, (protected) user data is fetched from any endpoint.
  This endpoint makes sure that the user requesting the data is authorized to do
  so. Here, with nextjs case you will use a
  [API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes)
  for fetching that user data. As the api route is server only functionality, it
  is safe to check for proper authentication there. You will build all that now.

- usually we get the user from the server side api. In web3 things are a little
  bit different. The user data comes from the _client-side_, namely the browser
  wallet extension that stores accounts with addresses and names. The
  server-side API will only be used for authorizing the users, i.e. verifying a
  signature and validating the signed data

Rendering and Static Generation, or have never heard of them.

## Configuring next-auth

Next-auth config is done in the `api/auth/[...nextauth.ts] file. There are many
options to configure next-auth to your needs, including different auth providers
and many more options. The repo you cloned already contains relevant config
options and we are not going to look at every single one. You can find all
config options described in the
[next-auth documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options).

For the purpose of the tutorial we are going to write a new
`CredentialsProvider` with a focus on the `authorize` function.

### A Custom CredentialsProvider

In this tutorial you will extend next-auth with a custom web3
`CredentialsProvider` that checks that certain criteria are met:

- the user has signed a message with their polkadot browser extension
- the message signature is correct
- the message nonce is correct (csrf protection)
- the other message data is correct (uri)
- **finally: the account passes the criteria of the token gate**

That means, that you will need to ask the user to sign a message with all
relevant data in the frontend, which will then be sent to the server, where it
is verified

## The `authorize` function

You need to provide your own logic in the `authorize` function, that takes the
credentials submitted and returns either a object representing a user or value
that is false/null if the credentials are invalid. In our case we want to return
an object of the following form:

```ts
interface User {
  id: string; //the account's substrate address
  name: string; //the account name
  ksmAddress: string; // the account's Kusama Address
  freeBalance: BN; // the free KSM balance of the account
}
```

:::info

You can return arbitrary data here. In our example we use `freeBalance` as the
tokengate checks it anyway and can be populated easily. When you use a different
token to check for, e.g. NFTs from a certain collection, you could e.g. store
`nfts: number[]` with all the NFTs from that collection a user holds.

:::

The following code snippet shows the full authorize function with annotations.
Have a look at it first and try to understand the parts for yourself, with a
special focus on the highlighted lines. We are adding all the checks that were
defined at the beginning of this section. Afterwards they will be explained.

```ts title="/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts" showLineNumbers
...
async authorize(credentials): Promise<any | null> {
    if (credentials === undefined) {
        return null;
    }

    try {
        const message = JSON.parse(credentials.message);

        // verify the message is from the same uri
        if (message.uri !== process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL) {
            return Promise.reject(new Error('ðŸš« You shall not pass!'));
        }

        // verify the message was not compromised
        if (message.nonce !== credentials.csrfToken) {
            return Promise.reject(new Error('ðŸš« You shall not pass!'));
        }

        // verify signature of the message
        // highlight-start
        const { isValid } = signatureVerify(
            credentials.message,
            credentials.signature,
            credentials.address,
        );
        // highlight-end

        if (!isValid) {
            return Promise.reject(new Error('ðŸš« Invalid Signature'));
        }

        // verify the account has the defined token
        // highlight-start
        const wsProvider = new WsProvider(
            process.env.RPC_ENDPOINT ?? 'wss://kusama-rpc.dwellir.com',
        );
        const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: wsProvider });
        await api.isReady;

        if (credentials?.address) {
            const ksmAddress = encodeAddress(credentials.address, 2);
            const accountInfo = await api.query.system.account(ksmAddress);

            if (accountInfo.data.free.gt(new BN(1_000_000_000_000))) {
            // if the user has a free balance > 1 KSM, we let them in
                return {
                    id: credentials.address,
                    name: credentials.name,
                    freeBalance: accountInfo.data.free,
                    ksmAddress,
                };
            } else {
                return Promise.reject(new Error('ðŸš« The gate is closed for you'));
            }
        }
        // highlight-end

        return Promise.reject(new Error('ðŸš« API Error'));
    } catch (e) {
        return null;
    }
},
...
```

So what is going on here? The interesting parts are the `signatureVerify`
function and the usage of the polkadot API.

1. `signatureVerify`: If the signature is valid, that means that it is really
   the holder of the private key that send the request.
2. The last check - if all other checks were successful - is the actual
   tokengate. In our example we use the polkadot API with RPC endpoint of the
   Kusama network, to retrieve the account's token balance of the KSM token. If
   the user's freeBalance is greater than 1 KSM, that is the only possible
   branch, where non null data is returned.

:::info

You hardcoded the RPC endpoint to a constant value, that the user can configure
in ther `.env` with a fallback to `wss://kusama-rpc.dwellir.com`. In a
production environment, you will most likely not rely on only one RPC endpoint
as a single point of failure. To mitigate, you can use a
[substrate connect light client](https://docs.substrate.io/learn/light-clients-in-substrate-connect/#integrate-in-apps-that-use-polkadot-js-api)

If you want to know more about how substrate chains store tokenbalances and what
`BN` is in the code above, read about
[Type Basics](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/types.basics/)

:::

Also notice the many `Promise.reject(...)` lines. That is to make sure that when
any issue appears, either signature validation, or other errors, no `user` is
returned,
[signalling next auth that the authentication was not successful](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/credentials#example---username--password)
and not showing the tokengated content.

### Adding the session provider

You already wrote your own Provider in the last section. The
[easiest way to find if someone is authenticated](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#usesession)
with next-auth is the `useSession` hook and the corresponding `SessionProvider`.
Remember how we already used the `session` in the `LoginButton` component in the
[first section of the tutorial](setup)?

So let's add that to the `pages/_app.tsx` as a wrapping provider to our dApp.

```tsx title="pages/_app.tsx" showLineNumbers
import "@/styles/globals.css";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { SessionProvider } from "next-auth/react";
import { PolkadotExtensionContextProvider } from "@/context/polkadotExtensionContext";

export default function App({
  Component,
  pageProps: { session, ...pageProps },
}: AppProps) {
  return (
    <SessionProvider session={session}>
      <PolkadotExtensionContextProvider>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
        <Analytics />
      </PolkadotExtensionContextProvider>
    </SessionProvider>
  );
}
```
