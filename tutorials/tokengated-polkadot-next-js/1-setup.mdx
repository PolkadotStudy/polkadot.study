# Setup and the User Interface

In the first part, you are going to setup the development environment for
developing the dApp. It's a
[basic next.js setup](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) with some
dependencies.

To get you started there is a github repo with stubs and relevant file
structures. Go ahead and clone it and checkout the `tutorial` branch that only
contains the stubs.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:niklasp/polkadot-js-tokengated-website.git
cd polkadot-js-tokengated-website
git checkout tutorial
```

Then install all dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

To start a development server run

```bash
yarn dev
```

You will notice some error outputs in the console when running the server, like:

```bash
[next-auth][warn][NEXTAUTH_URL]
https://next-auth.js.org/warnings#nextauth_url
[next-auth][warn][NO_SECRET]
https://next-auth.js.org/warnings#no_secret
```

That is because the repo uses environment variables for different settings. The
repo contains a `/.env.local.example` file. Go ahead and rename that file to
`.env.local` and change the variables if you want. Now the error message should
be gone

:::caution

In a production environment, the security of your dApp / authentication relies
on `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` being long and secure and not shared. The `NEXTAUTH_URL`
should also point to something else in production.

:::

Great. Now that the dependencies and development environment are setup, you can
build the UI in the next step.

## User Interface

We are going to build two main UI components in this demo:

1. The _Account Select_ Component, which will allow a user to select the wallet
   they want to use for the dApp. It will use `accounts` data from the hook we
   will write in the
1. The _Login Button_ Component, which will handle login state, call login
   functionality, and display feedback on error and loading to the user.

### Account Select

The Account Select component will be a simple dropdown that lets the user select
the account they want to use for the website. It needs to interact with the
browser wallet extension (we use the polkadot.js extension in this tutorial), in
order to receive all `accounts`. It also stores the index of the currently
selected account.

First, have a look at in `components/account-select.tsx`. Think about how you
would do it yourself, first before proceeding. The `accounts` are given, try to
write a `<select>` with `<option>` and an `onChange` function, that calls the
`setActingAccountIdx` function.

Next, let's write the component.

```js showLineNumbers title="components/account-select.tsx"
export default function AccountSelector() {
  const { accounts, actingAccount, setActingAccountIdx } =
    usePolkadotExtensionWithContext();

  return (
    <select
      onChange={(event) => {
        const accountIdx = accounts
          ? accounts.findIndex(
              (account) => account.address === event.target.value.address
            )
          : 0;
        setActingAccountIdx(accountIdx);
      }}
      value={actingAccount?.address}
    >
      {accounts?.map((acc) => (
        <option key={acc.address} value={acc.address}>
          {acc.meta?.name} - {acc.address}
        </option>
      ))}
    </select>
  );
}
```

The most relevant part is the `onChange` function that updates the
`actingAccountIdx` state variable, when the user changes the selected element
from the dropdown.

Now the only thing is missing is the `accounts`. In the next part of the
tutorial you will code a react _ContextProvider_ that will provide all accounts
(as well as other app state variables) to the `AccountSelect` component. You
will afterwards update this component but leave it for now and look at the next
UI component you need.

### Login Button

The `LoginButton` component is more complex than the `AccountSelect` but it will
be breaken down into parts in this paragraph. Have a look at the
`components/login-button.tsx` file.

You will find 2 `TODO`s

1. to write the `handleLogin` function.
1. to write the component JSX

The JSX is the easier part, you can try yourself before proceeding. There should
be 2 nested branches that will change the UI:

- If `accounts` is defined and has a length
- If `session` is defined and not null

We will look at the `handle login` together below.

```js title="components/login-button.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { useState } from "react";
import { useSession, signIn, signOut, getCsrfToken } from "next-auth/react";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import Link from "next/link";

import { usePolkadotExtensionWithContext } from "@/context/polkadotExtensionContext";
import AccountSelect from "./account-select";

import styles from "@/styles/Home.module.css";
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export default function LoginButton() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const [error, setError] = (useState < string) | (undefined > undefined);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

  // TODO write ContextProvider
  const { accounts, actingAccount, injector } =
    usePolkadotExtensionWithContext();

  const handleLogin = async () => {
    // TODO login functionality will come here
  };

  // a next-auth hook that will return the session data, i.e. the authenticated user
  // used to handle component state
  const { data: session } = useSession();

  return (
    <>
      // highlight-next-line
      {accounts && accounts.length > 0 ? (
        <>
          <div className={styles.cardWrap}>
            <div className={styles.dropDownWrap}>
              {!session && <AccountSelect />}
            </div>
            // highlight-next-line
            {session ? (
              <>
                <Link href="/protected-api" className={styles.card}>
                  <h2 className={inter.className}>
                    ðŸŽ‰ View Tokengated Route <span>-&gt;</span>
                  </h2>
                  <p className={inter.className}>
                    You passed the tokengate {session.user?.name}. You can now
                    view the protected route.
                  </p>
                </Link>
                <div
                  role="button"
                  onClick={() => signOut()}
                  className={styles.card}
                >
                  <h2 className={inter.className}>
                    Sign Out <span>-&gt;</span>
                  </h2>
                  <p className={inter.className}>
                    Click here to sign out your account {session.user?.name}.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </>
            ) : (
              <div
                role="button"
                // highlight-next-line
                onClick={() => handleLogin()}
                className={styles.card}
              >
                <h2 className={inter.className}>
                  ðŸ”‘ Let me in <span>-&gt;</span>
                </h2>
                <p className={inter.className}>
                  Click here to sign in with your selected account and check if
                  you can view the tokengated content. <br></br>

                </p>
              </div>
            )}
          </div>
          {isLoading ? (
            <>Signing In ...</>
          ) : (
            <span className={styles.error}> {error} </span>
          )}
        </>
      ) : (
        <div className={styles.walletInfo}>
          <p>
            Please{" "}
            <a
              className={styles.colorA}
              href="https://polkadot.js.org/extension/"
            >
              install a polkadot wallet browser extension
            </a>{" "}
            to test this dApp.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have already installed it allow this application to access
            it.
          </p>
        </div>
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

Until now, the file basically contains the imports we will need plus some jsx
logic. Take some minutes to understand the above code. The outer conditional
checks wether there is data in `accounts` (Line 33). If not, there is likely no
polkadot browser extension installed, or the user has not granted the dApp
access. In that case, a message with a link to download and install the
extension is displayed.

In the case of available accounts, there is another conditional, checking if the
`session` variable is present (Line 39). If it is, the user is successfully
authenticated already, and we show a logout button. If the `session` is not
available, the user is not authenticated and a button that calls the
`handleLogin` function is displayed.

After copying the code you will have some errors. That is, like in the
`AccountSelect` component, because you have not defined the
`usePolkadotExtensionWithContext()` function yet. You will do that in the
[next chapter](connecting-to-the-wallet-browser-extension). But first focus on
the `handleLogin` function that is a stub.

#### Handle the login

The `handleLogin` function is responsible for 4 important things:

1. Constructing a `message` that contains relevant information about the user
   who is trying to authenticate, and also _what_ they are authenticating
   against.
1. Ask the browser extension to `sign` that message by the user
1. Send that signature to the next server side where it can be used to check if
   it is really the account making the request
1. Updating the UI with feedback for the user (loading, error).

Have a look at the function before

```js title="components/login-button.tsx" showLineNumbers
const handleLogin = async () => {
  try {
    setIsLoading(true);
    let signature = "";
    const message = {
      statement:
        "Sign in with polkadot extension to the example tokengated example dApp",
      uri: window.location.origin,
      nonce: await getCsrfToken(),
      version: "1",
    };

    const signRaw = injector?.signer?.signRaw;

    if (!!signRaw && !!actingAccount) {
      // after making sure that signRaw is defined
      // we can use it to sign our message
      const data = await signRaw({
        address: actingAccount.address,
        data: JSON.stringify(message),
        type: "bytes",
      });

      signature = data.signature;
    }

    // will return a promise https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#using-the-redirect-false-option
    const result = await signIn("credentials", {
      redirect: false,
      callbackUrl: "/protected-api",
      message: JSON.stringify(message),
      name: actingAccount?.meta?.name,
      signature,
      address: actingAccount?.address,
    });

    // take the user to the protected page if they are allowed
    if (result?.url) {
      router.push("/protected-api");
    }

    setError(result?.error);
    setIsLoading(false);
  } catch (error) {
    setError("Cancelled Signature");
    setIsLoading(false);
  }
};
```

**Message and Signature**

The browser extensions can be used to sign arbitrary data with the private keys
of the acting account. This signature alongside the corresponding public key can
then be used to verify that it was really the user who signed the message. The
message contains

- a `statement` that will be shown in the browser extension signature dialog and
  notify the user about what they are signing. It is one part of making sure the
  user signed something _from our dApp_ and not from any other dApp
- a `uri` to verify that the user interacted with the dApp at a specific uri
- a `nonce` to mitigate replication attacks, i.e. if someone gets access to the
  signature, that signature cannot be used _again_ to login into your dApp
- and finally a `version`: the version of the dApp might change in critical
  ways, rendering signatures invalid. We are not using it in our dApp but it is
  a good practice to have.

All those data are _signed_ which means that with that signature, we can really
verify that the private key has used our dApp at the `uri` with the specified
version.

That was a lot. Take a moment to go over the material in this chapter again and
make sure you understood things. The following two chapters will teach you about
how to populate the `accounts` we used in several places already and how
next-auth is used to create the actual token gated authentication.
