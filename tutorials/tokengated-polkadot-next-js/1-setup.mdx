# Setup and the User Interface

In the first part, you are going to setup the development environment for
developing the dApp. It's a
[basic next.js setup](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) with additional
dependency installations.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

As we will be using next-auth and polkadot-js, you will install those
dependencies, too.

```bash
npm install next-auth
```

## User Interface

We are going to build two main UI components in this demo:

1. The _Account Select_ Component, which will allow a user to select the wallet
   they want to use for the dApp.

### Account Select

### Login Button
