# Setting up Metadata Portal

Metadata Portal is a CLI and a self-hosted web page that shows you the latest metadata for a given network.

This is an important addition to Polkadot Vault, which can update the metadata inside only through a special video QR code without going online.

Parity Technologies hosts its own version of the Portal for Polkadot and Kusama.

External users (chain owners) are be able to deploy their versions of metadata portal if they want.

## Host your own Metadata Portal
