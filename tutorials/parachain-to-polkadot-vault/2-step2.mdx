# Running local node

For the purpose of this tutorial, you need to have a running blockchain node.
You can either run a node locally or use any public node.

Examples of public nodes that you can experiment with are:
- wss://acala-rpc.dwellir.com
- wss://rpc.astar.network
- wss://spiritnet.kilt.io

However, for better understanding, I will run a blockchain from a template locally.

## Run a blockchain node locally.
Clone the template repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template.git
```
Go to the template directory:
```bash
cd substrate-node-template
```

### Build

Use the following command to build the node without launching it:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

**Note:** Depending on your operating system and Rust version, there might be additional packages required to compile this template.
Check the [installation](https://docs.substrate.io/install/) instructions for your platform for the most common dependencies.
Alternatively, you can use one of the [alternative installation](#alternative-installations) options.


### Single-Node Development Chain

The following command starts a single-node development chain that doesn't persist state:

```bash
./target/release/node-template --dev
```

The node is reachable via the following RPC endpoints:
- JSON-RPC API on [http://localhost:9933](http://localhost:9933)
- WebSocket API on [ws://localhost:9944](ws://localhost:9944).
