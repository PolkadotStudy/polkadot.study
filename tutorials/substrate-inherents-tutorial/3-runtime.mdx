# Runtime
Now it's time to develop the second part of your Inherents project - the Runtime side.

Please head to the ```pallets``` folder as you're going to use and modify the ```template``` pallet
as a base pallet.
First of all change the ```template``` subfolder name to ```inherents-example```.

The most of the necessary changes will refer to the ```lib.rs``` file where the pallet is defined.

Let's include some types:
```rust title=pallets/inherents-example/lib.rs
use sp_std::vec::Vec;
use sp_inherents::{InherentIdentifier, IsFatalError};
use sp_core::{Encode, Decode};
use sp_runtime::traits::Zero;

/// Type for Scale-encoded data provided by the block author
type InherentRawType = Vec<u8>;

pub const INHERENT_IDENTIFIER: InherentIdentifier = *b"ext_data";
```
You also added a private type alias ```InherentRawType``` which represents bytes vector of Scale-encoded inherent data passed from the Client.

The ```INHERENT_IDENTIFIER``` is the 8-byte-long key you already used on the Client side to put the encoded data into the storage.

The next thing is to add ```InherentDataType``` declaration into the ```Config``` trait;
```rust title=pallets/inherents-example/lib.rs
#[pallet::config]
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
	/// Because this pallet emits events, it depends on the runtime's definition of an event.
	type RuntimeEvent: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;
	/// Type representing the weight of this pallet
	type WeightInfo: WeightInfo;
	/// Actual type of inherent data
	type InherentDataType: Default + Encode + Decode + Clone + Parameter + Member + MaxEncodedLen;
}
```
and its corresponding definition for the ```Runtime``` implementing the ```Config``` trait in ```runtime/src/lib```:
```rust title=runtime/src/lib.rs
/* snip */
pub type InherentDataType = u16;
```
Now back to ```pallets/inherents-example/lib.rs```, define the pallet's Storage Item:
```rust title=pallets/inherents-example/lib.rs
// Storage items for inherent data created by the block author
#[pallet::storage]
pub type StoredInherentData<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, T::InherentDataType, OptionQuery>;
```
The next step is to define the unsigned extrinsic that will be submitted as a result of inherent receipt, and the corresponding ```Event``` that will be triggered upon extrinsic call success as well as the ```Error``` for the case of failure outcome:
```rust title=pallets/inherents-example/lib.rs
#[pallet::event]
#[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)]
pub enum Event<T: Config> {
	/// Triggered when 'set' transaction succedes
	InherentDataSet { data: T::InherentDataType  },
}

// Errors inform users that something went wrong.
#[pallet::error]
pub enum Error<T> {
	/// Triggered when the inherent data is already set for the current block
	AlreadySet,
}

#[pallet::call]
impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
	/// Unsigned extrinsic submitted by create_inherent(..) 
	#[pallet::call_index(0)]
	#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::set())]
	pub fn set(origin: OriginFor<T>, inherent_data: T::InherentDataType) -> DispatchResult {
		// as this call is created by block auth it is supposed to be unsigned
		ensure_none(origin)?;
		ensure!(StoredInherentData::<T>::get().is_none(), Error::<T>::AlreadySet);

		StoredInherentData::<T>::put(&inherent_data);
		
		Self::deposit_event(Event::InherentDataSet { data: inherent_data });

		Ok(())
	}
}
```

The essential thing a pallet that provides and/or verifies an inherent extrinsic must do is to implement a ```ProvideInherent``` trait:
```rust title=pallets/inherents-example/lib.rs
// This pallet provides an inherent, as such it implements ProvideInherent trait
// https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/frame_support/inherent/trait.ProvideInherent.html
#[pallet::inherent]
impl<T: Config> ProvideInherent for Pallet<T> {
	type Call = Call<T>;
	type Error = InherentError;
	const INHERENT_IDENTIFIER: InherentIdentifier = INHERENT_IDENTIFIER;
	// This method is used to decide whether this inherent is requiered for the block to be accepted
	fn is_inherent_required(data: &InherentData) -> Result<Option<Self::Error>, Self::Error> {
		// we could return Ok(None) to indicate that this inherent is not required. 
		// This happens by default if altenative implementation of is_inherent_required is provided
		// Here for demonstration we return Ok(Some(..)) if inherent data is present and successfully decoded, expecting
		// that inherent is required in this case.
		Ok(Self::get_and_decode_data(data)
			.map(|_| InherentError::InherentRequiredForDataPresent))
	}

	fn create_inherent(data: &InherentData) -> Option<Self::Call> {
		// create and return the extrinsic call if the data could be read and decoded
		Self::get_and_decode_data(data)
			.map(|inherent_data| Call::set {inherent_data})
	}
	// Determine if a call is an inherent extrinsic
	fn is_inherent(call: &Self::Call) -> bool {
		matches!(call, Call::set {..})
	}
}
```

And the final thing left to do is to implement and embed your pallet into the Runtime, as usual:
```rust title=runtime/src/lib.rs
/// Configure the inherents-example in pallets/inherents_example.
impl inherents_example::Config for Runtime {
	type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
	type WeightInfo = inherents_example::weights::SubstrateWeight<Runtime>;
	type InherentDataType = InherentDataType;
}
// Create the runtime by composing the FRAME pallets that were previously configured.
construct_runtime!(
	pub struct Runtime
	where
		Block = Block,
		NodeBlock = opaque::Block,
		UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic,
	{
        /* snip */
		InherentsExample: inherents_example,
	}
);

```
