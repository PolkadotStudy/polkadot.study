# Client
## Inherent Data Provider
A block producing node relies on an ```InherentDataProvider``` whenever it is interested to pass
data to the runtime upon authoring a new block.
An ```InherentDataProvider``` trait implementor utilizes the ```provide_inherent_data``` method to put data into 
storage under a key both the Client and the Runtime share.

As the first step you'll define a struct implementing the aforementioned ```InherentDataProvider``` trait.

Please head to `./node/src` folder and add a file ```inherent_data_provider.rs``` with the following code:

```rust title=node/src/inherent_data_provider.rs
use sp_inherents::{InherentIdentifier, InherentData};
use node_template_runtime::{InherentDataType};
use node_template_runtime::inherents_example::{INHERENT_IDENTIFIER};
use async_trait;
use std::fmt::Debug;
use sp_core::Encode;

/// The provider of inherent data from the Node to the Runtime
/// It holds data of InherentDataType defined by the Runtime
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ExternalDataInherentProvider(pub Option<InherentDataType>);

/// Implementation of sp_inherents::InherentDataProvider trait for ExternalDataInherentProvider 
#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl sp_inherents::InherentDataProvider for ExternalDataInherentProvider {
	async fn provide_inherent_data(
		&self,
		inherent_data: &mut InherentData,
	) -> Result<(), sp_inherents::Error> {
        if let Some(ref data) = self.0 {
            inherent_data.put_data(INHERENT_IDENTIFIER, &data.encode())
        } else {
            Ok(())
        }
	}

	async fn try_handle_error(
		&self,
		identifier: &InherentIdentifier,
		error: &[u8],
	) -> Option<Result<(), sp_inherents::Error>> {
		// handle only data identified by INHERENT_IDENTIFIER key, ignore the rest
		if *identifier == INHERENT_IDENTIFIER {
            Some(Err(sp_inherents::Error::Application(Box::from(std::format!("Error processing inherent: {:?}", error)))))
		} else {
            None
        }
	}
}

``` 

This code references a few data types that you'll later define on the Runtime side.
Let's have a look at them.

The line 
```rust
use node_template_runtime::{InherentDataType}
```
references the type of the inherent as it is understood by the Runtime. Your inherent data provider will hold
an instance of this type which it will pass to the Runtime in a SCALE-encoded format.

Then we have
```rust
use node_template_runtime::inherents_example::{INHERENT_IDENTIFIER}
```
which is the key under which the block producer passes inherent data to the Runtime. 

The struct ```ExternalDataInherentProvider``` holds the data you want the block producer to pass to the Runtime
and implements the trait ```InherentDataProvider``` by putting it onto storage from which the data will be then
fetched and decoded by the Runtime.

## Create Inherent Data Provider
Now when your inherent data provider is ready it must be used by the block production.
Inherent data provider instances are created by a closure passed to the consensus block production module.
Please head to the file ```node/src/service.rs``` and locate the 
```rust title=node/src/service.rs
create_inherent_data_providers: move |_, ()| async move {
    let timestamp = sp_timestamp::InherentDataProvider::from_system_time();

    let slot =
        sp_consensus_aura::inherents::InherentDataProvider::from_timestamp_and_slot_duration(
            *timestamp,
            slot_duration,
        );

    Ok((slot, timestamp))
},
```
code snippet.

There are two identical snippets in the file, at the moment we are going to concentrate
on that referred by ```sc_consensus_aura::start_aura```.
You can see that there are already two inherent data providers returned by the closure which
AURA uses to pass inherent data to the Runtime when it produces a block.
AURA passes the current time and slot inherents to the Runtime.

You are going to create you custom inherent data provider, so your data is also passed to the Runtime:

```rust title=node/src/service.rs
create_inherent_data_providers: move |_, ()| async move {
    let timestamp = sp_timestamp::InherentDataProvider::from_system_time();

    let slot =
        sp_consensus_aura::inherents::InherentDataProvider::from_timestamp_and_slot_duration(
            *timestamp,
            slot_duration,
        );

    let external_data_provider = crate::inherent_data_provider::ExternalDataInherentProvider(inherent_data);

    Ok((slot, timestamp, external_data_provider))
},
```

Now, we need to receive the ```inherent_data``` from somewhere. As a simplest solution we could just hardcode it. 
A slightly more interesting option is to inject it from outside, for example as a constant CLI parameter.
Please modify the ```new_full``` function signature as follows:
```rust title=node/src/service.rs
pub fn new_full(mut config: Configuration, inherent_data: Option<InherentDataType>) -> Result<TaskManager, ServiceError> {
```

## Client CLI
Now add the ```inherent_data``` into ```node/src/cli.rs```:

```rust title=node/src/cli.rs
use node_template_runtime::{InherentDataType};

#[derive(Debug, clap::Parser)]
pub struct Cli {
	#[command(subcommand)]
	pub subcommand: Option<Subcommand>,

	#[clap(flatten)]
	pub run: RunCmd,

	#[clap(long)]
	pub inherent_data: Option<InherentDataType>,
}
```
and a modification is necessary for ```node/src/command.rs```:

find the code snippet where ```new_full(...)``` is called and change it like so:
```rust title=node/src/command.rs
/* snip */
None => {
    let runner = cli.create_runner(&cli.run)?;
    let inherent_data = cli.inherent_data;
    runner.run_node_until_exit(|config| async move {
        service::new_full(config, inherent_data).map_err(sc_cli::Error::Service)
    })
},
```
