# Why this tutorial exists

Developers are the backbone of any blockchain ecosystem, and we need to build tools which will help them create useful dApps on Polkadot. 
dApps on Polkadot are commonly written in ink!, but so far scaffolding ink! dApps is not easy. 
All that associated complexity often discourages new devs trying to enter the ecosystem. 

With the ink!athon Boilerplate, we abstracted away a lot of complexity on the frontend- and contract-levels to give developers a starting point to setup their new first ink! project with a working pre-configured but un-opinionated workspace. 
In order to improve the developer experience for dApp tinkerers within the ecosystem, we have created this tutorial on how to effectively utilise the boilerplate. 
This tutorial will guide you along your journey creating your first full-stack ink! dApp on Polkadot. 

First, we will launch an ink! dApp within minutes using the boilerplate. 
Then, we will go through detailed steps on how to expand the dApp’s features. 
At the end of this tutorial, we hope the boilerplate would please a lot of new devs and it would be their primary solution as dApp builders.

## Time of completion

The first section (running the boilerplate) will only take a few minutes to complete. 
The complete tutorial will take around 3 hours to complete.

## What you'll learn
At the end of this tutorial, we hope that:
- You will learn how to develop a full-stack ink! dApp with the boilerplate
- You will also learn how a simple ink! contract works, how to build and deploy it both locally and on a testnet
- You will gain insights on how the frontend (in Next.js) interacts with the contract
- You will learn how to extend the dApp's features and deploy the frontend to Vercel and other platforms (via Docker)

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of using terminal and Node.js is required
- Knowledge of React, Next.js, and Rust is not required but will be helpful
