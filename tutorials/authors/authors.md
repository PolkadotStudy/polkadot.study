# Looking for Authors (March 2023)

Polkadot.study is currently in its first phase of planing and organizing.

**We are looking for tutorial authors who want to help kickstart this new educational platform for developers by contributing tutorials.** You can write about anything Polkadot related.

The funds allocated for each tutorial is 1300â‚¬ or ~$1400. The estimated work load would be around 15h for planing, writing and revisions.

If that sounds interesting for you, if you are a developer in Polkadot / Kusama and have anything you want to write about, that you feel would be a great tutorial for others - get in touch via the contact options below.

:::info status

As we just began creating polkadot.study, everything is just being created, as you read this. That includes guidelines for authors on how to contribute and how to structure their tutorials. All documents will be created in by March. If you want to start already, send an outline via the channels above.
