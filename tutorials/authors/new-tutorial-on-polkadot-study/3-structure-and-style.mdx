## Tutorial Structure

polkadot.study tutorials should have a consistent structure, to create a stable
learning environment which makes it easy to follow.

Our tutorials should be procedural, which walk the reader through accomplishing
a task or understanding a complex concept step-by-step. The tutorial should be
divided in different parts, also mirrored in the file structure. The structure
for a procedural tutorial should orientate itself on the following structure:

### File intro.mdx

- **Title** (Level 1 heading)
  - When you write your title, think about what the reader will accomplish by
    following your tutorial. Try to include the goal of the tutorial in the
    title, not just the tool(s) the reader will use to accomplish that goal.
    Ideally, titles will be under 60 characters long.
  - A typical title for a procedural tutorial follows this format: **How To
    \{Accomplish a Task\} with \{Software\}**.
  - [Title Capitalization](https://capitalizemytitle.com/)
- **Introduction** (Text below the title)
  - What is the tutorial about (software, components, concepts)
  - Why should the reader read the tutorial
  - What will the reader do / create
  - What new skills will the reader have after the tutorial
- **Time of completion** (Level 2 heading)
  - How long does it normally take to finish the tutorial including the time for
    reading and coding
- **What you'll learn** (Level 2 heading)
  - List of concepts the reader will learn
- **Prerequisites** (Level 2 heading)
  - In the form of a checklist, the requirements / knowledge to complete the
    tutorial
  - If possible links to learning those requirements
- **Author** (Level 2 heading - optional)
  - If you want to add a paragraph about yourself, your story, your developer
    path, your current position or research - this is the place. You can also
    add links to your profile(s).

### File: 1-first-step.mdx

:::info You can choose any file name you like. You can also prefix every
filename with a number in order to keep things organized. This very file you are
reading is e.g. named `1-structure-and-style.mdx`. Have a look
[in the repo](https://github.com/PolkadotStudy/website/tree/staging/tutorials/authors/new-tutorial-on-polkadot-study)
to see how file naming can be handled. :::

- **Step 1 / Subtopic 1 — Doing the First Thing or expaining the first thing**
  (Level 2 heading)
  - What will the reader build / learn in this step
  - [Title Capitalization](https://capitalizemytitle.com/)

### File: 2-another-step.mdx

- **Step 2 / Subtopic 2 — Doing the Next Thing or expaining the next thing**
  (Level 2 heading)
- …

### File: 3-conclusion.mdx

- **Conclusion** (Level 2 heading)
  - What was learned
- **further study** (Level 2 heading)
  - What can the reader do next, where can they deepen their aquired knowledge

:::note todo Link and explain the tutorial template. You can add as many steps
as you wish to your tutorial. :::

## Tutorial Style

The style for _polkadot.study_ articles reflects our purpose in publishing them:
to provide quality learning information for developers inside and outside the
Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. We aim tu ensure our tutorials are:

- Comprehensive and written for all experience levels
- Technically detailed and correct
- Practical, useful, and self-contained
- Friendly but formal
- No discrimination against the following, but not limited to: age, disability,
  ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, religion,
  political affiliation, sexual orientation, socioeconomics, technology choices
- Favor second person ("You will build ...") over first person ("I think")

These principles guide authors to create articles, tutorials, and other learning
materials that help people solve their problems and grow as developers.
Comprehensive and written for all experience levels

We encourage and help our authors to submit clear and detailed as possible
articles without making too much assumptions about the reader’s or writer's
background knowledge.

Every command or code a reader needs for the final result of a tutorial should
explicitly been included (or be the solution of a quiz). Any needed background
information to complete the background tutorial should be noted (in
Prerequisites) and in the best case also Links should be given to learn these
prerequisites. **The goal is to have tutorials that teach the concepts of
something, not to deliver copy and paste code.**

> We avoid words like "simple,” "straightforward,” “easy,” “simply,”
> “obviously,” and “just,” as these words make assumptions about the reader’s
> knowledge. While authors use these words to encourage and motivate readers to
> push through challenging topics, they often have the opposite effect; a reader
> who hears that something is “easy” may be frustrated when they encounter an
> issue. Instead, we encourage our readers by providing the explanations they
> need to be successful. Technically detailed and correct
>

<Task>I will try my best to stick to the style guidelines</Task>

### Images in your tutorial

Most likely you will like to add images to your tutorial. It is best to put them
in a subfolder of your main tutorial repository. The name of the folder should
be `/assets`. When you copied the tutorial template, you will already have that
folder.

Now you can add images by adding the markdown.

```md
![Alt Text](./assets/<your-filename.png>)
```

:::info

Please remember to use alt text for your images.

:::

### Code Blocks in your Tutorial

- provide more details than just code
- do not provide large code blocks in the tutorial, if there is need for larger
  code blocks, use gists, or link to a github repo that can be cloned
- every code example should be followed by an explanation of what it does and
  why it works that way - help readers understand what they do and learn
- every code example should be tested by the author at the time of writing

### Interactive Elements in your Tutorial

Interactive elements like quizzes and tasks can help to make a tutorial more fun
and help in understanding learned concepts. A reader can self asses if they
understood the concepts.

:::info Javascript code only works in `.mdx` files not in `.md` files, so make
sure to name your tutorial file accordingly. :::

#### Quizzes

<Quiz quizItem={question} />

The above quiz component is generated by the following code parts. You put both
of them in your .mdx file.

First, import the required component and set it up.

```js
import Quiz from "/src/components/quiz";

export const question = {
  question: "Why should I insert quizzes in my tutorial?",
  answers: [
    "It's fun",
    "You can provide feedback on a learned concept in the `explanation` field",
    "It might encourage a reader to read more closely in order to get the quiz correct",
    "You just shouldn't",
  ],
  correctAnswerIdx: [0, 2],
  msgCorrect: "Correct answer. Good job.",
  msgIncorrect: "Incorrect answer. Please try again.",
  explanation:
    "Some extra explanation that will appear when the user answered the questioin correctly.",
};
```

Then use the quiz component anywhere in your tutorial.

```js
<Quiz quizItem={question} />
```

#### Tasks

Tasks are interactive elements, that ask the user to check a box. When a user
wants to proceed to the next part of the tutorial and not all _mandatory_ tasks
on the page are checked, the next button will be disabled and instead take them
to the first unfinished task they need to do before proceeding.

<Task>I have completed this task</Task>

use the code below

```js
import Task from '/src/components/task';
...
<Task>I have completed this task</Task>
```

Tasks are mandatory by default, if you want to create a task that is optional,
use the following code

```js
<Task mandatory={false}>I have completed this task</Task>
```

:::info

The Task component is still being worked on, the goal is to have a UI flow like
