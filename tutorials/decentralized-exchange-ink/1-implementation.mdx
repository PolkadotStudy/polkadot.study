# Implementation

- What did the user learn and create?
- Why was the approach useful?

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]

const PRECISION: u128 = 1_000_000;

#[ink::contract]
pub mod automated_market_maker {

    use ink_prelude::collections::BTreeMap;

    /// Section 0: Definition of a storage

    #[ink(impl)]

    impl AutomatedMarketMaker {

        /// Constructor

        /// Business logic, functions like:
            -   Providing new liquidity to the pool
            -   Swap
            -   Removing liquidity from a pool
            -   Liquidity constant of a pool

    }

        /// Utils, errors definitions

    }
}
```
