# Conclusion

This is the end of the tutorial. You already built basic but working decentralized exchange written in ink! smart contract language. 

In case of any question, there is a dedicated [Substrate Stack Exchange](https://substrate.stackexchange.com) where you can get help while building your awesome project.

Experimentation serves as an invaluable means of acquiring extensive experience in ink! and Rust language programming. Engaging in such experimentation empowers individuals to delve deeper into the intricacies of these languages. By authoring additional tests, identifying bugs, and implementing novel features, like incorporating external tokens into a decentralized exchange, developers can further enhance their proficiency and broaden their skillset. Good luck!
