As a software engineer, perception of your work has been **changed**. Before the advent of digital platforms, you was supposed to deliver source code, maybe tests, maybe documentation. In the era of digital platforms you are suppose to deliver value.

Yes, it is seismic change in our work. This change can be considered seismic because it represents a significant transformation in the way software engineers are perceived and the impact they are expected to have. Instead of solely focusing on technical aspects, such as code quality and functionality, software engineers are now expected to consider the broader context and deliver solutions that provide tangible value to users, customers, and the business as a whole. **Overall, this change in perception underscores the evolving nature of software engineering and the increasing importance of delivering value in the digital age.**

# Conclusion

This is the end of the tutorial. You already built basic but working decentralized exchange written in ink! smart contract language. In case of any question, there is a dedicated [Substrate Stack Exchange](https://substrate.stackexchange.com) where you can get help while building your awesome project.

Experimentation serves as an invaluable means of acquiring extensive experience in ink! and Rust language programming. Engaging in such experimentation empowers individuals to delve deeper into the intricacies of these languages. By authoring additional tests, identifying bugs, and implementing novel features, like incorporating external tokens into a decentralized exchange, developers can further enhance their proficiency and broaden their skillset. Good luck!
