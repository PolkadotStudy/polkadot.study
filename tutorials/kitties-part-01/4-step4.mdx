# Kitties pallet: Uniqueness, custom types and storage maps

This section dives into some pillar concepts for developing pallets with FRAME (Framework for Runtime 
Aggregation of Modularized Entities):

- Writing a storage struct.
- Implementing the randomness trait.
- How to use existing types and traits.
- How create your own types like providing your pallet with a Gender type. 

Also, at the end of this part, you will have implemented the remaining two storage items according to the 
logic outlined for the Substrate Kitties application.

### Kitty struct

An Struct in Rust is a useful construct to help store data that have things in common. For our purposes, 
our Kitty will carry multiple properties which we can store in a single struct instead of using separate 
storage items. This comes in handy when trying to optimize for storage reads and writes so our runtime can 
perform less read/writes to update multiple values. Read more about storage best practices 
[here](https://doc.deepernetwork.org/v3/runtime/storage/#best-practices).

#### What information to include?

Let's first go over what information a single Kitty will carry:

* `dna`: the hash used to identify the DNA of a Kitty, which corresponds to its unique features. 
DNA is also used to breed new Kitties. An will be used as key in the storage.
* `price`: this is a balance that corresponds to the amount needed to buy a Kitty and set by its owner.
* `gender`: an enum that can be either Male or Female.
* `owner`: an account ID designating a single owner.
* `generation`: to keep track of the number of generations a Kitty has been bred for.

#### Sketching out the types held by our struct

Looking at the items of our struct from above, we can deduce the following types:

* `[u8; 16]` for dna - to use 16 bytes to represent a Kitty's DNA.
* `BalanceOf` for price - this is a custom type using FRAME's Currency trait.
* `Gender` for gender - we are going to create this!
* `u64` for generation.

So we get the following as our kitty struct.

Copy it to replace the `TODO` for the kitty struct:

```rust
// Struct for holding kitty information
	#[derive(Clone, Encode, Decode, PartialEq, RuntimeDebug, TypeInfo, MaxEncodedLen)]
	#[scale_info(skip_type_params(T))]
	pub struct Kitty<T: Config> {
		// An array of 16 bytes representing the kitty's DNA.
		pub dna: [u8; 16],

		// The price of the kitty, stored as an optional balance.
    	// If set to `None`, it assumes the kitty is not for sale.
		pub price: Option<BalanceOf<T>>,

		// The gender of the kitty.
		pub gender: Gender,

		// The owner of the kitty, stored as the account ID.
		pub owner: T::AccountId,

		// Generation of the kitty, stored as a u64.
		pub generation: u64,
	}
```

Notice how we use the derive macro to include various helper traits for using our struct. We have already
added `TypeInfo` in order to give our struct access to this trait.

For type `Gender`, we will need to build out our own custom enum and helper functions. Now is a good time 
to do that.

### Gender enum

We have just created a struct that requires a custom type called `Gender`. This type will handle an enum 
defining our Kitty's gender. To create it, you'll build out the following parts:

* An enum declaration, which specifies Male and Female values.
* Implement a helper function for our Kitty struct.

1. Declare the custom enum

Replace `TODO: Enum that represents the gender of a kitty` with the following code:

```rust
// Represents the gender of a kitty.
	#[derive(Clone, Encode, Decode, PartialEq, Copy, RuntimeDebug, TypeInfo, MaxEncodedLen)]
	// We need this to pass kitty info for genesis configuration
	#[cfg_attr(feature = "std", derive(Serialize, Deserialize))]
	pub enum Gender {
		Male,
		Female,
	}
```

Notice the use of the derive macro which must precede the enum declaration. This wraps our enum in the 
data structures it will need to interface with other types in our runtime. In order to use `Serialize` and 
 `Deserialize`, you will need to add the serde crate in `pallets/kitties/Cargo.toml` as follows:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0.136", optional = true }

[features]
default = ["std"]
std = [
	"codec/std",
	"frame-benchmarking?/std",
	"frame-support/std",
	"frame-system/std",
	"scale-info/std",
	"sp-io/std",
	"sp-runtime/std",
	"serde",
]
```

Great, we now know how to create a custom struct. But what about providing a way for a Kitty struct to be 
assigned a gender value?

2. Implement a helper function for our Kitty struct

Configuring an struct is useful in order to pre-define a value in our struct. For example, when setting a 
value in relation to what another function returns. In our case we have a similar situation where we need 
to configure our Kitty struct in such a way that sets `Gender` according to a Kitty's DNA.

We'll create a function called gen_dna that returns a tuple of DNA and gender for a kitty.

Replace `TODO: Generates and returns DNA and Gender for a new kitty` with the following:

```rust
// Generates and returns DNA and Gender for a new kitty.
		pub fn gen_dna() -> ([u8; 16], Gender) {
			// Create randomness
			let random = T::KittyRandomness::random(&b"dna"[..]).0;

			// Create randomness payload. Multiple kitties can be generated in the same block,
			// retaining uniqueness.
			let unique_payload = (
				random,
				frame_system::Pallet::<T>::extrinsic_index().unwrap_or_default(),
				frame_system::Pallet::<T>::block_number(),
			);

			// Turns into a byte array
			let encoded_payload = unique_payload.encode();
			let hash = blake2_128(&encoded_payload);

			// Generate Gender
			if hash[0] % 2 == 0 {
				// Males are identified by having a even leading byte
				(hash, Gender::Male)
			} else {
				// Females are identified by having a odd leading byte
				(hash, Gender::Female)
			}
		}
```
Make sure to spend some time understanding the logic behind this function. Check the comments for some guidance.

### On-chain randomness

If we want to be able to tell these Kitties apart, we need to start giving them unique properties! In 
the previous step, we've made use of `KittyRandomness` which we haven't defined yet. Let's get to 
it.

We'll be using the [`Randomness`](https://docs.rs/frame-support/latest/frame_support/traits/trait.Randomness.html) trait from [`frame_support`](https://docs.rs/frame-support/latest/frame_support/index.html#) to do it. It will generate a random seed that we'll use to create 
unique Kitties and breed new ones.

In order to use the `Randomness` trait for our pallet, we must:

1. Define a new type bound by Randomness trait in our pallet's configuration trait:

The `Randomness` trait from `frame_support` requires specifying it with a paramater to replace the 
`Output` and `BlockNumber` generics. For our purposes, we want the output of functions using this 
trait to be `Blake2 128-bit hash` which you'll notice should already be declared at the top of your 
working codebase.

Replace `TODO: The type of Randomness we want to specify for this pallet.` with the following:

```rust
/// The type of Randomness we want to specify for this pallet.
type KittyRandomness: Randomness<Self::Hash, Self::BlockNumber>;
```
2. Specify the actual type in our runtime

Given that we have added a new type in the configuration of our pallet, we need to config our runtime to 
set its concrete type. This could come in handy if ever we want to change the algorithm that 
`KittyRandomness` is using, without needing to modify where it's used inside our pallet.

To showcase this point, we're going to set the `KittyRandomness` type to an instance of FRAME's 
[`InsecureRandomnessCollectiveFlip`](https://docs.rs/pallet-insecure-randomness-collective-flip/latest/pallet_insecure_randomness_collective_flip/) 
(It is called insecure because it should be used for only low security situations). Conveniently, the Node Template already has an instance 
of the `InsecureRandomnessCollectiveFlip` pallet. All you need to do is set the `KittyRandomness` type in your runtime, inside `./runtime/src/lib.rs`:

 ```rust
/// Configure the pallet-template in pallets/template.
impl pallet_template::Config for Runtime {
	type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
	type Currency = Balances;
	type KittyRandomness = RandomnessCollectiveFlip;
}
 ```


### Remaining storage items

#### Understanding storage item logic

To track the kitties we're going to standardize the logic to use an ID as key for the each storage item. This means that a single unique 
key will point to a Kitty object (i.e. the struct we previously declared).

In order for this to work, we need to make sure that the ID for a new Kitty is unique. We can do 
this with a new storage item called `Kitties`, which will be a mapping from an ID to the Kitty object.

With this we can check for collisions by checking whether this storage item already contains a mapping using a 
particular ID. For example, from inside a dispatchable function we could check using:

```rust
ensure!(!<Kitties<T>>::exists(new_id), "This new id already exists");
```

Our runtime needs to be made aware of:

* Unique assets, like currency or Kitties (this will be held by a storage map called `Kitties`)
* Ownership of those assets (this will be handled a new storage map called `KittiesOwned`)

### Using a [StorageMap](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/frame_support/storage/types/struct.StorageMap.html)

To create a storage instance for the Kitty struct, we'll be using a `StorageMap` â€” a hash-map provided to us
 by FRAME.

Here's what the Kitties storage item looks like:

```rust
/// Maps the kitty struct to the kitty DNA.
#[pallet::storage]
pub(super) type Kitties<T: Config> = StorageMap<
    _, 
    Twox64Concat, 
    [u8; 16], 
    Kitty<T>
>;
```
Breaking it down, we declare the storage type and assign a StorageMap that takes:

* The `Twox64Concat` hashing algorithm.
* A key of type `[u8; 16]`.
* A value of type `Kitty<T>`.

The `KittiesOwned` storage item is similar except that we'll be using a `BoundedVec` from  `frame_support::pallet_prelude` to keep track of 
some maximum number of Kitties we'll configure in `./runtime/src/lib.rs`.

Using a bounded vector is useful when you want to enforce resource constraints or prevent unexpected resource consumption. 
In this case, it ensures that the storage item `KittiesOwned` can only hold a specific number of Kitties, which can be configured in 
`./runtime/src/lib.rs` to match the desired limit.

```rust
/// Track the kitties owned by each account.
#[pallet::storage]
pub(super) type KittiesOwned<T: Config> = StorageMap<
	_,
	Twox64Concat,
	T::AccountId,
	BoundedVec<[u8; 16], T::MaxKittiesOwned>,
	ValueQuery,
>;
```
Your turn! Copy the two code snippets above to replace `TODO: Storage that maps the kitty struct to the kitty DNA.` and `TODO: Storage that tracks the kitties owned by each account.`

Before we can check if our pallet compiles, we need to add a new type `MaxKittyOwned` in the `config` 
trait, which is a pallet constant type (similar to `KittyRandomness` in the previous steps). Replace 
`TODO: The maximum amount of kitties a single account can own.` with:

```rust
/// The maximum amount of kitties a single account can own.
#[pallet::constant]
type MaxKittiesOwned: Get<u32>;
```
Finally, we define `MaxKittyOwned` type in `./runtime/src/lib.rs`. This is the same pattern as we 
followed for `Currency` and `KittyRandomness` except we'll be adding a fixed `u32` using the 
`parameter_types!` macro:

```rust
parameter_types! { 
	// One can own at most 9,999 Kitties
	pub const MaxKittyOwned: u32 = 9999;
}

/// Configure the pallet-template in pallets/template.
impl pallet_template::Config for Runtime {
	type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
	type Currency = Balances;
	type KittyRandomness = RandomnessCollectiveFlip;
	type MaxKittiesOwned = MaxKittyOwned;
}
```
Now is a good time to check that your Kitties blockchain compiles!

```bash
cargo build --release
```
