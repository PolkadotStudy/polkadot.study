# Kitties pallet: Interacting with your Kitties

Up until this point in the tutorial, we've built a chain capable of only creating and tracking the 
ownership of Kitties. Now that that's done, we want to make our runtime more like a game by introducing 
other functions like buying and selling Kitties

We will first need to enable users to mark and update the price of their Kitties. Then we can add 
functionality to enable users to transfer, buy, and breed Kitties.

Since the workflow of what we already done will be repeated for the remaining functions, we'll be giving 
the code for each new functionality and explaining what each function does in the comments.

### Set price

Replace `TODO: Set the price for a kitty.` with:

```rust
// Set the price for a kitty.
///
/// Updates the price of a kitty and updates it in storage.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `origin` - The origin of the call.
/// * `kitty_id` - The DNA of the kitty.
/// * `new_price` - The new price for the kitty.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns an error if:
/// * The caller is not from a signed origin.
/// * The kitty with the given ID does not exist.
/// * The caller is not the owner of the kitty.
#[pallet::call_index(5)]
#[pallet::weight({0})]
pub fn set_price(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    kitty_id: [u8; 16],
    new_price: Option<BalanceOf<T>>,
) -> DispatchResult {
    // Make sure the caller is from a signed origin
    let sender = ensure_signed(origin)?;

    // Ensure the kitty exists and is called by the kitty owner
    let mut kitty = Kitties::<T>::get(&kitty_id).ok_or(Error::<T>::NoKitty)?;
    ensure!(kitty.owner == sender, Error::<T>::NotOwner);

    // Set the price in storage
    kitty.price = new_price;
    Kitties::<T>::insert(&kitty_id, kitty);

    // Deposit a "PriceSet" event.
    Self::deposit_event(Event::PriceSet { kitty: kitty_id, price: new_price });

    Ok(())
}
```

### Transfer

Replace `TODO: Directly transfer a kitty to another recipient.` with:

```rust
/// Directly transfer a kitty to another recipient.
///
/// Any account that holds a kitty can send it to another account. This will reset the asking price
/// of the kitty, marking it not for sale.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `origin` - The origin of the call.
/// * `to` - The account ID of the recipient.
/// * `kitty_id` - The DNA of the kitty to be transferred.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns an error if:
/// * The caller is not from a signed origin.
/// * The kitty with the given ID does not exist.
/// * The caller is not the owner of the kitty.
#[pallet::call_index(3)]
#[pallet::weight({0})]
pub fn transfer(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    to: T::AccountId,
    kitty_id: [u8; 16],
) -> DispatchResult {
    // Make sure the caller is from a signed origin
    let from = ensure_signed(origin)?;
    let kitty = Kitties::<T>::get(&kitty_id).ok_or(Error::<T>::NoKitty)?;
    ensure!(kitty.owner == from, Error::<T>::NotOwner);
    Self::do_transfer(kitty_id, to, None)?;
    Ok(())
}
```
This will need another helper function, `do_transfer`. Replace `TODO: Update the storage to transfer a 
kitty from one owner to another.` with:

```rust
/// Update the storage to transfer a kitty from one owner to another.
pub fn do_transfer(
    kitty_id: [u8; 16],
    to: T::AccountId,
    maybe_limit_price: Option<BalanceOf<T>>,
) -> DispatchResult {
    // Get the kitty
    let mut kitty = Kitties::<T>::get(&kitty_id).ok_or(Error::<T>::NoKitty)?;
    let from = kitty.owner;

    ensure!(from != to, Error::<T>::TransferToSelf);
    let mut from_owned = KittiesOwned::<T>::get(&from);

    // Remove kitty from list of owned kitties.
    if let Some(ind) = from_owned.iter().position(|&id| id == kitty_id) {
        from_owned.swap_remove(ind);
    } else {
        return Err(Error::<T>::NoKitty.into());
    }

    // Add kitty to the list of owned kitties.
    let mut to_owned = KittiesOwned::<T>::get(&to);
    to_owned.try_push(kitty_id).map_err(|_| Error::<T>::TooManyOwned)?;

    // Mutating state here via a balance transfer, so nothing is allowed to fail after this.
    // The buyer will always be charged the actual price. The limit_price parameter is just a 
    // protection so the seller isn't able to front-run the transaction.
    if let Some(limit_price) = maybe_limit_price {
        // Current kitty price if for sale
        if let Some(price) = kitty.price {
            ensure!(limit_price >= price, Error::<T>::BidPriceTooLow);
            // Transfer the amount from buyer to seller
            T::Currency::transfer(&to, &from, price, ExistenceRequirement::KeepAlive)?;
            // Deposit sold event
            Self::deposit_event(Event::Sold {
                seller: from.clone(),
                buyer: to.clone(),
                kitty: kitty_id,
                price,
            });
        } else {
            // Kitty price is set to `None` and is not for sale
            return Err(Error::<T>::NotForSale.into());
        }
    }

    // Transfer succeeded, update the kitty owner and reset the price to `None`.
    kitty.owner = to.clone();
    kitty.price = None;

    // Write updates to storage
    Kitties::<T>::insert(&kitty_id, kitty);
    KittiesOwned::<T>::insert(&to, to_owned);
    KittiesOwned::<T>::insert(&from, from_owned);

    Self::deposit_event(Event::Transferred { from, to, kitty: kitty_id });

    Ok(())
}
```
The `do_transfer` function is more complex than is necessary for a transfer. This is because it is already
dealing with the logic of a sale. We'll be using this function again in the next extrinsic.

### Buy

Replace `TODO: Buy a kitty that is listed for sale.` with:

```rust
/// Buy a kitty that is listed for sale.
///
/// The `limit_price` parameter acts as a safeguard against the possibility that the seller front-runs
/// the transaction by setting a high price. A front-end should assume that this value is always equal
/// to the actual price of the kitty. The buyer will always be charged the actual price of the kitty.
///
/// If successful, this dispatchable will reset the price of the kitty to `None`, making it no longer
/// for sale, and handle the balance and kitty transfer between the buyer and seller.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `origin` - The origin of the call.
/// * `kitty_id` - The DNA of the kitty to be purchased.
/// * `limit_price` - The maximum price the buyer is willing to pay.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns an error if:
/// * The caller is not from a signed origin.
#[pallet::call_index(4)]
#[pallet::weight({0})]
pub fn buy_kitty(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    kitty_id: [u8; 16],
    limit_price: BalanceOf<T>,
) -> DispatchResult {
    // Make sure the caller is from a signed origin
    let buyer = ensure_signed(origin)?;
    // Transfer the kitty from seller to buyer as a sale
    Self::do_transfer(kitty_id, buyer, Some(limit_price))?;

    Ok(())
}
```
As you can see, the `buy_kitty` function is also using the transfer function. The only difference is 
that the transference is done as a sale or a payment gated transference.

### Breed

Replace `TODO: Breed two kitties to give birth to a new kitty that is a combination of both parents.` with:

```rust
/// Breed two kitties to give birth to a new kitty that is a combination of both parents.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `origin` - The origin of the call.
/// * `parent_1` - The DNA of the first parent kitty.
/// * `parent_2` - The DNA of the second parent kitty.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns an error if:
/// * The caller is not from a signed origin.
/// * One or both of the parent kitties do not exist.
/// * The caller is not the owner of both parent kitties.
/// * The parent kitties are not of opposite genders.
#[pallet::call_index(1)]
#[pallet::weight({0})]
pub fn breed_kitty(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    parent_1: [u8; 16],
    parent_2: [u8; 16],
) -> DispatchResult {
    // Make sure the caller is from a signed origin
    let sender = ensure_signed(origin)?;

    // Get the kitties.
    let maybe_mom = Kitties::<T>::get(&parent_1).ok_or(Error::<T>::NoKitty)?;
    let maybe_dad = Kitties::<T>::get(&parent_2).ok_or(Error::<T>::NoKitty)?;

    // Check both parents are owned by the caller of this function
    ensure!(maybe_mom.owner == sender, Error::<T>::NotOwner);
    ensure!(maybe_dad.owner == sender, Error::<T>::NotOwner);

    // Parents must be of opposite genders
    ensure!(maybe_mom.gender != maybe_dad.gender, Error::<T>::CantBreed);

    // Create new DNA from these parents
    let (new_dna, new_gender) = Self::breed_dna(&parent_1, &parent_2);

    // Generation is the higher of the two parents' generations + 1
    let generation = maybe_mom.generation.max(maybe_dad.generation) + 1;

    // Mint new kitty
    Self::mint(&sender, new_dna, new_gender, generation)?;
    Ok(())
}
```
This will need another helper function, `breed_dna`. Replace `TODO: Generates a new kitty DNA by 
combining DNA fragments from two parent kitties.` with:

```rust
// Generates a new kitty DNA by combining DNA fragments from two parent kitties.
pub fn breed_dna(parent1: &[u8; 16], parent2: &[u8; 16]) -> ([u8; 16], Gender) {
    // Call `gen_dna` to generate random kitty DNA
    // We don't know what Gender this kitty is yet
    let (mut new_dna, new_gender) = Self::gen_dna();

    // randomly combine DNA using `mutate_dna_fragment`
    for i in 0..new_dna.len() {
        // At this point, `new_dna` is a randomly generated set of bytes, so we can
        // extract each of its bytes to act as a random value for `mutate_dna_fragment`
        new_dna[i] = Self::mutate_dna_fragment(parent1[i], parent2[i], new_dna[i])
    }
    // return new DNA and gender
    (new_dna, new_gender)
}
```
This is also using another helper function called `mutate_dna_fragment`. Replace `TODO: Picks from two 
existing DNA fragments based on a random value.` with:

```rust
// Picks from two existing DNA fragments based on a random value.
fn mutate_dna_fragment(dna_fragment1: u8, dna_fragment2: u8, random_value: u8) -> u8 {
    // Given some random u8
    if random_value % 2 == 0 {
        // either return `dna_fragment1` if its an even value
        dna_fragment1
    } else {
        // or return `dna_fragment2` if its an odd value
        dna_fragment2
    }
}
```
The breeding logic is to randomly pick a DNA fragment from each parent kitty and combine them to form a 
new kitty.

This will make more sense when we look at the UI section. The descendants of a pair of kitties will
have some DNA fragments from each parent kitty.

For example, in the following image, who do you think are the parents of the only kitty in generation 1?

## Build, run and interact with your Kitties

If you've completed all of the preceding parts and steps of this tutorial, you're ready to run your chain 
and start interacting with all the new capabilities of your Kitties pallet!

Build and run your chain using the following commands:

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/node-template --tmp --dev
```
Now check your work using the [Polkadot-JS Apps] (https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer) just like we 
did previously. Once your chain is running and connected to the PolkadotJS Apps UI, perform these manual 
checks:

* Fund multiple users with tokens so they can all participate.
* Have each user create multiple Kitties.
* Try to transfer a Kitty from one user to another using the right and wrong owner.
* Try to set the price of a Kitty using the right and wrong owner.
* Buy a Kitty using an owner and another user.
* Use too little funds to purchase a Kitty.
* Breed a Kitty and check that the new DNA is a mix of the old and new.

After all of these actions, confirm that all users have the correct number of Kitties; that the total 
Kitty count is correct; and any other storage variables are correctly represented.
