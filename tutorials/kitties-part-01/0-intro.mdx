# How to build the Substrate Kitties Chain

![kitties](./assets/kitties.png)

Welcome to the Substrate Kitties tutorial part 1. Designed to teach how to build a blockchain that handles 
the creation and ownership management of NFT Kitties.

It will cover various aspects of building the Kitties pallet, including creation, breeding, 
transfer, price setting, and purchasing kitties. Additionally, it will provide guidance on developing the 
front-end UI for interaction with the chain.

This tutorial is an updated/adapted version of two previous tutorials, the [CryptoKitties on Substrate](https://www.shawntabrizi.com/substrate/cryptokitties-on-substrate/)
and the [Build the Substrate Kitties Chain](https://doc.deepernetwork.org/tutorials/v3/kitties/pt1/). The current tutorial uses the polkadot-v0.9.39 version of
the Substrate Node Template. It was also added some extra sections exploring the node template and the polkadot-js javascript console.

## What we will build?

A substrate based blockchain for Kitties that can do the following:

- Be created either by some original source or by being breed using existing Kitties.
- Be sold at a price set by their owner.
- Be transferred from one owner to another.

## Time of completion

- It should take between 4 - 8 hours to complete this tutorial.

## What you'll learn?

- Learn patterns for building and running a Substrate node.
- Write and integrate a custom FRAME pallet to your runtime.
- Learn how to create and update storage items.
- Write pallet extrinsics and helper functions.
- Use the PolkadotJS API to connect to a Substrate node.

## Prerequisites

- Rust knowledge. If you are new to Rust, check the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) or [intro article](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust).
- Substrate Knowledge. For instance: what is a pallet, a runtime, a node, etc. If you are new to 
Substrate, check the [Substrate Developer Hub](https://substrate.dev/).
