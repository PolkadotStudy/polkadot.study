# Using the Tutorial Template

To get you started quickly at writing and guarantee a minimum amount of organization overhead, we created a tutorial template, 
that you can use as a starting point for your new tutorials. Read below to find out how to use it, adapt it, and make it visible.

## Copying the Template Files

The tutorial template is located in the repository at `docs/tutorials/tutorial-template`.

To start a new tutorial with hints and preformatted headings, go ahead and copy that folder to a new folder in the same parent directory.

Afterwards rename the folder to a name that describes your tutorial. The folder name will later also be the slug, that is displayed
in a user's browser, so make it precise and short. Also only use alphanumeric keys alongside the `-` character.

:::note Example

Let's say the tutorial name is `How to build a OpenGOV frontend with polkadot.js`, a good folder name could be `opengov-with-polkadot-js`.

:::

Make sure you *copy* the files and do not just rename the template folder, so authors coming after you can still use a fresh template for their tutorials.

After you completed this step, the folder structure should e.g. look like the following

```
docs/tutorials
├── ...
├── opengov-with-polkadot-js
│   ├── 0-intro.mdx
│   ├── 1-step1.mdx
│   ├── 2-step2.mdx
│   └── 3-conclusion.mdx
├── tutorial-template
│   ├── 0-intro.mdx
│   ├── 1-step1.mdx
│   ├── 2-step2.mdx
│   └── 3-conclusion.mdx
└── ...
```

:::info

You might notice, that all filenames are prefixed with a number. That is not mandatory but helps at structuring. If you reference your files, you can omit the numbers as you can see in the next step.

## Adding your Tutorial to the Tutorial Sidebar

After copying the tutorial template and renaming it, you want to wire it to a sidebar in order for readers to find your tutorial when navigating the page.
Polkadot.study uses two different sidebar definitions in the file `sidebars.js`. The array you want to add your navigation item to is called `tutorialSidebar`.
Add the following code to index 1 of the array, directly after `intro`. 

```js title="/sidebars.js"
const sidebars = {
    tutorialSidebar: [
        'intro',
        //begin your sidebar - copy below
        {
            type: 'category',
            label: 'Tutorial Template',
            link: {
                type: 'doc',
                id: 'tutorials/[your-folder-name]/intro',
            },
            items: [
                'tutorials/[your-folder-name]]/intro',
                'tutorials/[your-folder-name]/step1',
                'tutorials/[your-folder-name]/step2',
                'tutorials/[your-folder-name]/conclusion'
            ],
        },
        //end: your sidebar - copy until here
        ...
    ]
```
It will place your new tutorial at the top, the most prominent position of the sidebar to make it well visible for readers.
Then **replace** the `label` with the title of your tutorial, or if it is too long, a shorter title that will be displayed in the sidebar.
Also, in the `link` and `items` attributes, make sure to set the correct folder name, by replacing `[your-folder-name]` with the folder name you chose above.
