# Setup the Development Environment

Before you learn about the recommended style and structure of your polkadot.study tutorial, we will walk you through the process of 
creating a local environment that you can later use for submitting your tutorial to our website and for local preview.

## Forking the Repository

Polkadot.study uses the [fork-and-pull-model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model). Meaning, that anyone can submit pull requests from their own forks of the repository.
The project maintainer, can then (after discussing, reviewing and revising) merge your changes to the main repository and make it part of the
website.

:::info
If you have never done pull requests, or worked with forks, read the [Github Docs Page](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) about it, to get you started
quickly.
:::

1. Go to the [polkadot.study github repository](https://github.com/PolkadotStudy/polkadot.study) and click the fork button at the top right.
![github fork button](/tutorials/new-tutorials-on-polkadot-study/github-fork.png)

1. Make settings adjustments if you want and click "Create Fork".

1. Clone the forked repository to your machine in order to make changes. You can copy the **forked** repository address, by clicking the blue `Code` button and then
```
git clone <your forked repo url>
```

You now have everything to start writing / developing locally, as well as a setup for later making a Pull Request to our repository. You might have noticed that the default branch is set to `staging`.
You can always see a preview of staging at [staging.polkadot.study](https://staging.polka.study/).

:::info 

If you get lost, or if anything is unclear, please contact [authors@polkadot.study](mailto:authors@polkadot.study) or [submit a github issue](https://github.com/PolkadotStudy/polkadot.study/issues).

## Running Locally
After you have forked and cloned the repository to your machine, to run it you need to install the dependencies with `npm`.

```
# go to the directory you cloned into, e.g.
cd polkadot.study
# install dependencies
npm install
```
:::info

If you do not have `node.js` and `npm` on your machine, please follow [this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). We currently use node `v18`.

### Running the docusaurus development server
To start the docusaurus dev server, do
```
npm run start
```

Then, navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). The dev server supports hot module loading and will automatically update when you change and save your tutorial files.

You cannot see any changes in the tutorial tab yet, just the ones others published, you will change that in the next step and wire your tutorial in.

## Updating your fork

Your fork might get outdated as others make changes to the `staging` branch. To keep your branch up to date [sync your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) from time to time, especially before submitting a PR.
