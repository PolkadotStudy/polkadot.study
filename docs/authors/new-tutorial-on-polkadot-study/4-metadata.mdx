Metadata helps structure polkadot.study. Docusaurs will create routes and pages
from information of your tutorials metadata and e.g. set page headers. That
enables users to navigate the website and also find your tutorial easier with
search engines. That is why you are encouraged to update the metadata of your
tutorial before submitting it.
