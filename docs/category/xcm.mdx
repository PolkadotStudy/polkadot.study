# XCM (Cross Consensus Messaging)

The Cross-Consensus Message Format, or XCM, is a messaging format and language used to communicate between consensus systems.

One of Polkadot's main functionalities is interoperability amongst parachains and any other participating consensus-driven systems. XCM is the language through which complex, cross-consensus interactions can occur. Two blockchains can "speak" XCM to seamlessly interact with each other using a standard messaging format.
