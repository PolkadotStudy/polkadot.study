# Polkadot.Study Report April 2023

I am happy with how Polkadot.study develops. Last month was focussed on Design,
Collaborations and including and writing the first tutorial. The frontend is 80%
done and is only missing some components and a design for tablets. I have not
found all the prospected authors I wanted but am confident I will find some in
the future but probably missing the deadline here.

See below for a more detailed report.

## Tutorials

- finished the
  [tutorial for authors](/docs/authors/new-tutorial-on-polkadot-study/intro)
- 3 funded authors are working on their tutorials
- 1 Author is working on a tutorial that they want no funding for
- Collaboration with Substrate in Bits to publish their content on
  polkadot.study
- Another Call for Authors made via the home

It seems that it will be hard to meet the deadline with the aimed 10 finished
tutorials until mid June. I have done several calls on twitter and PBA Alumni
Channels as well as Kusama Direction and chatted with 2 people but never heard
from them since then. Going forward, I would try to find new authors on
different channels (e.g. doing a call in the PBA Alumni Newsletter this week). I
also added a banner on the polkadot.study website and hope that the finished
design will help onboard new authors.

On top of that I will this month contact several parachain teams to ask if they
want to contribute tutorials to the platform.

### Substrate in Bits

I collaborated with Abdulbee (@abdulbee:matrix.org) to include _Substrate in
Bits_ in Polkadot.study
[here](https://staging.polka.study/tutorials/substrate-in-bits/). He is the
author of a
[successful treasury proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4wgb2uEk7Uy77XwaKtM-L6NMlZFB0wIH7hb4U4VVyM/edit#)
and, you can track the progress [here](https://airtable.com/shrrqq3AdMIbaJ4xT)

### New Docusaurus Plugin

- Created a reusable docusaurus plugin because polkadot.study needed more
  functionality than the available plugins offered:
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/@niklasp/docusaurus-plugin-content-tutorials
  - It is still a wip but can be build upon.
  - Uses modern typescript build pipeline
  - raised several issues with docusaurus github that came up along the way
  - restructured the repository to make it easier for authors to add their
    tutorials
  - Allow filtering of tutorials
  - allow custom meta tags for tutorial _Duration_ and difficulty _Level_ that
    will display in the frontend
- The Docusaurus Docs

## Design

Worked with the designers on the new page design. Currently only for Desktop +
Mobile but Tablet Design will finish soon. Have a look at the
[figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/96CEzoZ7KZyydMzJm2stM3/Polkadot-Study?type=design&node-id=334-608&t=irPj4hTzNtO4729E-0)

- Tutorial Cards
- Landing Page
- Components
- Icons from Polkadot Icons
- Study Paths filter Component

## Miscellaneous

- Merged the current progress to production branch at
  [https://polkadot.study/](https://polkadot.study/)
- Did a first review on a tutorial
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dlkTKbd-IOxad7H2BabvPIUICb6laU_fmcQEDoF3o2Y/edit
- Started with the concept of tag pages:
  https://polkadot.study/tutorials/tags/polkadot-js and contacted different
  people to setup an initial version (xcm, substrate)
