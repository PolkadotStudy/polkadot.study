# Polkadot.Study Report April 2023

## Functionality

- 

### New Docusaurus Plugin
- Created a reusable docusaurus plugin because polkadot.study needed more functionality than the available plugins offered: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@niklasp/docusaurus-plugin-content-tutorials 
    - It is still a wip but can be build upon.
    - Uses modern typescript build pipeline
    - raised several issues with docusaurus github that came up along the way

## Tutorials

- finished the [tutorial for authors](/docs/authors/new-tutorial-on-polkadot-study/intro)
- 3 funded authors are working on their tutorials
- 1 Author is working on a tutorial that they want no funding for
- Collaboration with Substrate in Bits to publish their content on polkadot.study
- Another Call for Authors made



## Design

Worked with the designers on the new page design. Currently only for Desktop but will finish soon.
