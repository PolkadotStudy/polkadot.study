What you currently see is only a quick preview of what the designers created in a first iteration. The design is going to be finished in the next 2 months. Tasks completed:

- Setup a design document for the designers and a slack channel.

## Components

A key part of the interactive tutorials on polkadot.study are the interactive react components. I have created the initial logic for those, so authors can already use them and play around.
