# Looking for Authors

_Are you a developer in the polkadot ecosystem? Have you learned something on
your polkadot developer journey? Why not share it with others?_

Polkadot Study is looking for people like you to write developer tutorials for
anything polkadot related. The funds allocated for each tutorial is **1314€ or
~$1400**. The estimated work load would be around 15h for planing, writing and
revisions.

If that sounds interesting to you, and have anything you want to write about,
that you feel would be a great tutorial for others or if you have any questions
or ideas - get in touch via the contact options below.
